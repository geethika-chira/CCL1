"Embarking on My Game Development Journey! 🎮✨"

Welcome to my very first semester project—a thrilling platformer game crafted with passion and creativity! 🚀💡

As a student at FH St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria, this project marks my first step into the exciting world of game development. From pixel-perfect jumps to immersive levels, I’ve poured my heart into bringing this game to life.

Stay tuned for more updates as I level up my skills and refine the experience! 🎨🕹️
