## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The game‚Äôs visual style and theme blended seamlessly, making the experience both engaging and immersive. Designing images was a fun and rewarding process.
- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity-based gameplay worked better than expected and provided a unique challenge.
- **Object designing** Successfully align all the game objects.

### Challenges:
- **Feature Limitations:** Some planned mechanics had to be shelved due to time constraints, requiring prioritization of essential gameplay elements.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky.
- **Background Changes for levels:** This was quit difficult as i had to change level 02 in different way.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Prioritizing quality over quantity led to a more polished game, proving that a well-executed single feature is better than multiple unfinished ones.
- **Time Management is Key:** Breaking tasks into smaller milestones helped keep development on track. Prioritizing core features over extras ensured a functional and polished game.
- **Bug Fixing is an Ongoing Process:** No matter how well-planned, unexpected glitches and edge cases will arise. Testing across different scenarios was essential in refining the mechanics.
