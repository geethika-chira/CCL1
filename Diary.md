🗓️ Day 1 - Introduction & Game Concept Brainstorming (13/01/2025)
- Our teachers introduced us to the overall implementation ideas and best practices for time management in development.
- We learned how to break down the project into manageable milestones, ensuring smooth progress throughout the semester.
- Discussion on tools and techniques for tracking progress, including GitHub for version control.
- Each student (including myself) presented their game ideas, outlining the core concept and mechanics.

🗓️ Day 2 - Building the Game Structure & Custom Background Design (14/01/2025)
- Today, I started building the basic structure of my platformer game.
- I used a template provided by Lukas, which served as a solid foundation for implementing the core framework.
- The template included:
    Predefined player movement scripts
    Basic collision detection
    A skeletal game loop to build upon
  - I experimented with different background images to find the best fit for the game’s atmosphere.
  - Using Photoshop and Krita, I designed and refined my own custom background to give the game a unique artistic touch.
 
🗓️ Day 3 - Implementing Basic Player Movement & Physics Adjustments (15/01/2025)
- Today, I focused on adding basic player movement mechanics to the game.
    Left & right movement using keyboard input
    Jumping mechanics with gravity simulation
    Basic collision detection with platforms

🗓️ Day 4 - Refining Game Physics for a Smoother Experience (16/01/2025)
- Today, I focused on fine-tuning the physics system to make movements feel natural and responsive.
- Adjustments made:
    Gravity tuning: Increased downward force slightly to reduce floaty jumps.
    Jump responsiveness: Added a buffer for late inputs so jumps feel smoother.
    Acceleration & deceleration: Introduced gradual speed buildup and stopping for better control.

🗓️ Day 5 - Designing Enemies, Blocks & Paths (17/01/2025)
- Today was all about visual design! I focused on creating key game assets using Photoshop and Krita to bring the world to life.
- Assets designed:
    Enemy sprites – Different character designs for in-game threats.
    Block textures – Platforms, walls, and destructible elements.
    Path visuals – Ground textures to make levels visually engaging.

🗓️ Day 6 - Continuing Asset Design: Enemies, Blocks & Paths (18/01/2025)
- Today, I continued working on enemy sprites, block textures, and path designs using Photoshop and Krita.
Focused on polishing details and ensuring a cohesive visual style.
- Assets refined:
    Additional enemy variations – Different types with unique designs.
    Improved block textures – Added shading & variations for depth.
    Finalized path visuals – Ensured seamless tiling for smooth level design

🗓️ Day 7 - Importing Finalized Assets into the Game Engine (20/01/2025)
- Today, I focused on importing all finalized assets into the game engine.
- Initial In-Game Testing
    Player & enemies appeared correctly in the engine.
    Some scaling issues with certain assets—adjusted sprite resolutions.
    Checked for tiling consistency in platforms and path visuals.

🗓️ Day 8 - Finalizing the First Level (21/01/2025)
- Today, I finalized the design and structure of the first level of my platformer game.
- Focused on balancing difficulty, ensuring smooth player progression, and adding interactive elements.
- Conducted several test runs to ensure the level flows well.
- Fixed minor issues like:
    Platform gaps that were too large for jumps.
    Collision bugs where the player could get stuck.

🗓️ Day 9 - Starting Level 2: Design & Mechanics (22/01/2025)
- Began working on Level 2, introducing new challenges and mechanics.
- Focused on making this level feel distinct from Level 1 while maintaining a natural progression.
- Designed different background and color scheme for level 02.

🗓️ Day 10 - Finalizing Level 2 & Fixing Minor Errors (23/01/2025)
- Wrapped up the Level 2 layout and mechanics.
- Conducted a thorough review across all levels to address minor bugs and inconsistencies.
- Gathered feedback and made tweaks to:
    Enemy difficulty
    Platforming challenge balance
    Level pacing

🗓️ Day 11 - Final Presentation & Project Showcase (24/01/2025)
- Today was the final presentation of my platformer game project!
- Shared the game with my friends and got the feedbacks.
- Successfully completed and presented my first platformer game project! 🎮🔥
- Learned valuable lessons in game design, programming, and time management.

🎉 Final Thoughts
This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I’m proud of the final result! 🚀 Looking forward to more game development challenges in the future!!!!!
